## 🎯 **Slide 1: Title Slide**

**Project Name**: **FairPass**  
**Tagline**: *"Reclaiming fairness in event access using blockchain."*  
**Team Focus**: SDG 10 (Reduced Inequality), SDG 9 (Innovation)  
**Category**: Blockchain for Good - Social Impact Technology

## 😤 **Slide 2: The Problem We're Solving**

> **Scalping. Counterfeit. Exclusion.**

### 📊 **The Crisis in Event Ticketing:**
- **$15+ billion** lost annually to ticket fraud and scalping
- **Bots & resellers** hoard tickets, locking out genuine fans
- **300% markup** on resale platforms hurts fans and artists
- **Zero proof** of attendance for community building
- **Geographic barriers** exclude global audiences
- **No fan loyalty** rewards or engagement tracking

### 💔 **Real Impact:**
- Families priced out of community events
- Artists lose connection with real fans
- Small venues struggle with fraud losses
- Cultural events become exclusive to the wealthy

## 💡 **Slide 3: FairPass Solution**

> **NFT-based ticketing system with programmable fairness rules.**

### 🎟️ **Core Innovation:**
- **ERC-721 NFT Tickets** → Unique, secure, traceable ownership
- **Controlled Resale** → Smart contract enforced price caps
- **DID-based Access** → Verified identity prevents bot attacks
- **Fair Distribution** → Anti-scalping mechanisms built-in
- **Proof of Attendance** → On-chain community building

### 🌍 **Blockchain for Good:**
- **Inclusive Access**: DID verification ensures real people, not bots
- **Economic Justice**: Price caps prevent exploitation
- **Community Building**: Attendance NFTs enable fan loyalty programs
- **Global Reach**: Crypto payments bypass banking limitations

## 🎬 **Slide 5: Demo User Journey**

### **🎥 Live Demo Flow (2 minutes):**

#### **1. Event Creation (Organizer)**
- Create event on FairPass platform
- Set: ticket quantity, price, max resale %, royalty %
- Deploy smart contract → Mint NFT batch

#### **2. Fair Fan Registration**
- Fan connects DID wallet (MetaMask + identity verification)
- Anti-bot queue system → lottery for high-demand events
- Purchase ticket → NFT appears in wallet with metadata

#### **3. Controlled Resale (Optional)**
- User lists ticket on integrated marketplace
- Smart contract enforces price cap (e.g., max 110% of original)
- Artist/organizer receives resale royalty (5-10%)

#### **4. Secure Entry**
- Dynamic QR code linked to NFT ownership
- Gate scanner verifies on-chain ownership
- Entry granted → Attendance recorded as NFT

#### **5. Community Building**
- Post-event: Fan receives POAP (Proof of Attendance)
- Loyalty rewards for frequent attendees
- Access to exclusive presales and community perks

## 🌍 **Slide 6: Social Impact & SDG Alignment**

### 🎯 **Sustainable Development Goals:**

#### **SDG 10 – Reduced Inequality**
- **Geographic Inclusion**: Global crypto payments bypass banking barriers
- **Economic Fairness**: Price caps prevent scalping exploitation
- **Bot Prevention**: DID verification ensures real people get tickets
- **Community Access**: Loyalty programs reward genuine fans

#### **SDG 9 – Industry Innovation**
- **Transparent Technology**: Open-source smart contracts
- **Sustainable Infrastructure**: Polygon's proof-of-stake (99% less energy)
- **Digital Inclusion**: Web3 education through ticketing

### 📈 **Measurable Impact:**
- **↓ 80%** reduction in scalping markup
- **↑ 60%** increase in verified fan attendance
- **$50M+** in fair savings returned to fans annually
- **100K+** new users onboarded to Web3

## 💰 **Slide 7: Business Model & Sustainability**

### **Revenue Streams:**
- **Primary Sales**: 2% platform fee per ticket minted
- **Resale Transactions**: 1% fee on secondary market
- **Premium Tools**: Analytics dashboard for organizers
- **NFT Loyalty**: Brand partnerships for fan rewards

### **Growth Strategy:**
- **Phase 1**: Music venues & local events (MVP)
- **Phase 2**: Major festivals & sports events
- **Phase 3**: Global expansion + DAO governance
- **Phase 4**: Cross-industry (conferences, travel, memberships)

### **Economic Impact:**
- Artists retain 5-10% of resale value (vs. 0% traditionally)
- Fans save 40-70% on legitimate resales
- Venues reduce fraud losses by 90%

## 🛠️ **Slide 8: Technical Innovation**

### **🔐 Anti-Fraud Security:**
```solidity
// Smart Contract Example: Resale Price Cap
function resellTicket(uint256 ticketId, uint256 price) public {
    require(ownerOf(ticketId) == msg.sender, "Not owner");
    require(price <= originalPrice * maxResaleMultiplier / 100, "Price too high");
    require(block.timestamp < eventDate, "Event already occurred");
    
    // Transfer with royalty to artist
    uint256 royalty = price * royaltyPercentage / 100;
    payable(artist).transfer(royalty);
    payable(msg.sender).transfer(price - royalty);
    
    _transfer(msg.sender, buyer, ticketId);
}
```

### **🎫 Dynamic QR Security:**
